Here is competitive analysis data in spreadsheet format (array of arrays). The first row defines the column names Please generate a strategy document in the following structure:

Feature names and categories
Performance ratings for our product vs competitors
Classification of features (e.g., Commodity, Differentiator, Exclusive, Untapped)
Current performance vs fan/user expectations
Strategic action recommendations

Based on this competitive analysis, please create a comprehensive strategy document with the following structure:
1. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW (2-3 Years)

Analyze our competitive position and identify key strengths/weaknesses
Define 3-4 core strategic pillars based on the data
Outline strategic themes by year (Year 1, 2, and 3)
Focus on protecting advantages, closing gaps, and exploring opportunities

2. 6-MONTH PRIORITY ROADMAP
Organize into two sections:
MUST-HAVE PROJECTS (Above the Line):

Select the 3 highest-impact projects that address critical gaps or leverage key advantages
For each project include:

Clear title with emoji indicator from original classification
SMART Goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
Scope description with 4-5 key deliverables
Business impact explanation
Timeline estimate
Resource requirements



BACKLOG PROJECTS (Under the Line):

3. SUCCESS METRICS & KPIS

Define primary success metrics (3-4 key measurements)
Define secondary metrics (3-4 supporting measurements)
Include specific percentage improvements and targets

4. RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

High-level team composition needed
Role breakdown with quantities

5. RISK MITIGATION

Identify 3-4 key risks and mitigation strategies

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:

Use markdown format suitable for artifacts
Include clear headers and subheaders
Use emoji indicators that match the original classification system
Make SMART goals bold and specific with measurable targets
Ensure all projects directly reference features from the uploaded analysis
Prioritize based on strategic impact, not just competitive gaps

ANALYSIS APPROACH:

Prioritize fixing underperforming commodity features (these hurt retention)
Protect and enhance exclusive/differentiator advantages
Explore untapped opportunities for growth
Consider resource constraints and realistic timelines
Balance short-term fixes with long-term strategic moves

Please analyze the uploaded document and create a comprehensive strategy following this exact structure and approach.
